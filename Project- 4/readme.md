#### My Wireframe

(./Images/wireframe.jpg)

One thing that I did chnage during this project was exicuting a different set up for the 550px site. After creating this wirframe I realized I could push this a little more and create a thrid dimention so that as the page grows the material grows with it. all I did was group the pink and image box together at 50% to make this happen.

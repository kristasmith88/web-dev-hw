### BEHOLD, my second ReadMe file!
This week I am feeling a little better as I now have a basic understanding of the layout. [Github](https://github.com/) and Atom have been working perfectly which has made the experience really fun to explore them a little bit more. I did notice that I am having to go back to look at the previous weeks instructions because I forget the steps of making a read me and the html for our sites. However this was very easy to navigate through and I am hoping that as we continue on I will get to the point when I dont need to look back at the step by step instructions. I am making to how to list though just in case.[smiley face](./images/Smiley.png)

### HTML & CSS Design and Build by Jon Duckett 
HTML & CSSOne thing that I **really** liked from this week was the readings from Jon Duckett. I liked it because it broke down everything we have been going over in class. Also, I was able to visually see what different launguages looked like as code and as text, which being a visual person helped me to *see* the differences.

### Project 2
I contemplated for a while on what I was going to be doing for project 2. Thats when I remembered its fall, and I am
ready for some baked apples!!! Im gearing up for making these delicious little deserts and sharing with you my moms
Baked Apple reciepe. Something that we enjoy every year as the leaved begin to fall and the heat turns to cool. I am still a little confused however with the nested lists but am hoping that I can figure this out before the assignment is due.

## Pt.2 of Instructables Website
### Tasks
1. Forms
2. Images
3. and Tables
OH MY!

This week provided to be a little more difficult for me. I was really struggling with my *table* for what seems like hours. I kept looking through the code and refering back to the "Tables" tab on week 5, but could not see what I was doing wrong. Finally I found it! I did not unclude the the table element at the beging of the table in order for it to work with the styling.

The *images* were actually really fun and very easy to work with. I had to played around a little bit with them and their sizing to get them to not stretch to much and fit properly into the space.

*Forms* was very cool to see the interworkings of how this works. I was employeed at a place where they were wanting this on the website and we could not figure out how to make that happen. Who knew it was so easy!? It will be interesting, if we get there, to see how they need to conect to other sites for the data to be collected, as for now, we are using example sites.

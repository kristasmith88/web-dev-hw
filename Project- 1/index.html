            <h2>Bear In There</h2>
            <h3>by Shel Silverstein</h3>
<p>There's a Polar Bear <br />In our Frigidaire-- <br />He likes it 'cause it's cold in there. <br />
With his seat in the meat <br />And his face in the fish <br />And his big hairy paws <br />In the buttery dish,
 <br />He's nibbling the noodles, <br />He's munching the rice, <br />He's slurping the soda, <br />
 He's licking the ice. <br />And he lets out a roar <br />If you open the door. <br />And it gives me a scare
 <br />To know he's in there-- <br />That Polary Bear <br />In our Fridgitydaire.</p>

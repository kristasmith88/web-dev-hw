# My First README.md
## Krista Smith

I am currently feeling a little overwheelmed as I have hit some hicups with the Atom program and Github, however I believe after working out these issues this is  going to be very fun!
I am looking forward to this course and learning about Web Design!

---
I have already **learned** so much from the first two topics in this course.
Here are some examples of what I have learned:
- The Web vs. the Internet
- Why Github is such an important tool
- How to create paragraphs and breaks within code

---
It has been a lot of information to take in but I am already *learning* so much in this course.
Over the next few months I am most excited to:
1. Have a deeper understanding of Github and how to use it
2. Learn the language inside and out
3. Discover the principal of website design

---
Take a look at what I have done so far!
I have organized and well labled my files as you can see in this image

Also, I learned the language to make a header! `# My First README.MD`

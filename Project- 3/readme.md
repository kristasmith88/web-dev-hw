## WEEK 2

I choose my colors and fonts based on the book cover for my poem. I decided to use one base color (pink) as the primary color to make the site feel a little more feminine with the modern sans font it was working with. The font Open Sans was choosen based on its thinness and uses of other fonts that go with is such as the bold, italic and slim. All being used within this site. I did notice that I had to elminate some of the fonts I was going to use as the file was to large and caused my site to slowly load.

One major issue I was having this week is getting the blocks placed inside another block with an image. I am hoping that this is something we will cover next week.

## WEEK 3

This week I struggled a little but and spent a chucnk of my time trying to reconfigure what my site should look like and how I was going to make that happen most efficently. A major thing I took away was the importance of really, and I mean REALLY, reading the direction of each weeks assignment throughly. Last week i should have spent more time on typeography and less time on the visual layout, images and boxes of my site, as this week I eilmated a lot of that work.

For my new layout I wanted to keep a clean and visual appeling site that is easy to navagate. The reviews on the index page are all ornainzed within a box to stay seperate from the other elemnts and are balanced with a photo. the about, sample work, and contact page are all different from one another but consist of the same fonts and colors to keep them consistant. I also decided to put a link to purchase the book within the sample page so that viewers would be able to easily access the full book if they were in to the poetry piece they were reading.

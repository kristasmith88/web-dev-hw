## WEEK 2

I choose my colors and fonts based on the book cover for my poem. I decided to use one base color (pink) as the primary color to make the site feel a little more feminine with the modern sans font it was working with. The font Open Sans was choosen based on its thinness and uses of other fonts that go with is such as the bold, italic and slim. All being used within this site. I did notice that I had to elminate some of the fonts I was going to use as the file was to large and caused my site to slowly load. 

One major issue I was having this week is getting the blocks placed inside another block with an image. I am hoping that this is something we will cover next week.

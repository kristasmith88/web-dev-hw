<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
    <p>While searching for a book to use for this project I came across this book of poems by Jana Prikryl. Some short, some long, all that I read were beautiful.
      What I really liked about her work was learning about where she came from. Her backstory is so interensting and so impressive to learn that she is now working for such a large publication.
      My favorite poem that I read was <strong>TO TELL OF BODIES CHANGED</strong> which I have inclued in the sample page.

               <h4>The_Reading_Wolf - Barnes & Nobles</h4>
               <p>This Czech-Canadian poet, Jana write beautifully. There is an art to her every word. It is a dance of words as they duel around one another, slicing and dancing on page, back and forth. Her words flow freely as it pours out smooth. This book brought such beauty to me as every word painted itself before me. (Also gorgeous cover). Jana writes so acrobatically and cleverly so!

               <h4>Roger Brunyate - Amazon.com </h4>
               <p>"The opening lines of "Argus, or Fear of Flying," the second poem in this collection by Czech-Canadian poet (and NYRB editor) Jana Prikryl. It is a striking image for any creative endeavor, that daring leap into the elements. If Prikryl had developed the bird image, say like Hopkins in "The Windhover," I would have been soaring right there with her. But she is a less physical poet than that, abstracting rather than realizing, using ideas as her safety net."</p>

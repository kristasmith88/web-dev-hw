     Having desired little <br>
        more than the<br>
        arrival of the little more<br>
        that arrives,<br>

     </div>

     <p>outside our window a cypress<br>
        of model proportions.<br>
        Its patience seems to widen<br>
        the nights we sleep in Rome.<br>
     </p>

     <p>Warm flags draw a tortoise,<br>
        it scrapes too near.<br>
        Our friends hurry over when they hear,<br>
        exclaiming over its mute<br>
        resolute<br>
        distinctness and helpless slow efforts to flee.<br>
     </p>

     <p>Density pours into swallows and shadows:<br>
        spilled with abandon each morning,<br>
        begins then the slow work<br>
        of receding.<br>
      </p>

     <p>The joints announce their new allegiances.<br>
        Metaphors swarm the surfaces of things.<br>
      </p>

     <p>Night broken into, it's the sub rosa<br>
        singling out<br>
        I ought to have expected<br>
        from Fra Angelico's small panel<br>
        among others,<br>
        the souped-up full-spectrum wings<br>
        combined with a mood of reverent submission<br>
        in both figures<br>
        warning of experience<br>
        yet to come.<br>
      </p>

     <p>Starting now she'll reason with herself<br>
        deliberately<br>
        (imagine bulbs expecting stars<br>
        for effort!), aware of being always overheard,<br>
        subject to unprecedented measures<br>
        of integrity, like an author.<br>
      </p>

     <p>While a substance of landscape, mineral,<br>
        leaches into blood vessels<br>
        quietly steadily, meaning in this case<br>
        nothing is damaged;<br>
        extravagance of umbrella pines<br>
        propping their fingers under the bonus horizons<br>
        of the hills, redundancies<br>
        boosting the city's resemblance to itself.<br>
      </p>

     <p>A painter once squared himself against a difficult question<br>
        and said no one could just create<br>
        a landscape,<br>
        but isn't it true<br>
        that expectation builds a neighborhood<br>
        and there is nowhere else that you can live.<br>
      </p>

     <p>It was possession, turns out, by a force whose intention<br>
        touched the first body alone, a body changed<br>
        again precisely to its own form,<br>
        a very special intention.<br>
      </p>

     <p>Alloyed<br>
        discretion, the grit of a damp trowel<br>
        explores my mouth, at leisure<br>
        determining<br>
        the candor that cavity<br>
        is good for.<br>
     </p>

     </div>

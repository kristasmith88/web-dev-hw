# My First README.md
## Krista Smith

I am currently feeling a little overwheelmed as I have hit some hicups with the Atom program and Github, however I believe after working out these issues this is  going to be very fun! I did re install the atom program and it seemed to fix all the bug I was having when trying to open the wed-dex-hw file in Github.
I am looking forward to this course and learning about Web Design!

---
I have already **learned** so much from the first two topics in this course.
Here are some examples of what I have learned:
- The Web vs. the Internet
- Why Github is such an important tool
- How to create paragraphs and breaks within code

---
It has been a lot of information to take in but I am already *learning* so much in this course.
Over the next few months I am most excited to:
1. Have a deeper understanding of Github and how to use it
2. Learn the language inside and out
3. Discover the principal of website design

During this week we also discovered the webiste [Waybackmachine.com](http://web.archive.org/) its a great site where you can search any website and look at its history. It was interesting looking at how one of my favorite museums website has developed from May 29,1997 to today. I also discovered that they have had 162,210 text/html captures since 1997! I also expored one of my favorite artist Jake Mathew site, which has only been up since 2009. It was clear that this site has a lot less traffic than the other sites I explored, as you can see it in its numbers.
We also learned how to look at the code from another site by right clicking and looking at the page source. I choose the [nationalgalliers.org](https://www.nationalgalleries.org) site as it has rotating pages and I was curions to see what the coding for that looked like. Honestly, the coding was so confusing to me it was hard to pull that information out but looking at the information for this site made me realize how much of the language it takes to make a good site!

Take a look at what I have done so far!
I have organized and well labled my files as you can see in this image

Also, I learned the language to make a header! `# My First README.MD`
